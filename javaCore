Describe the lifecycle of an object instance in Java and how garbage collection works
- instatiated by new where memory is allocated, constructor is called
- once an object is unreachable it is destroyed from memory
Describe how the basic data types are represented in memory (boolean, int, long, String, array of ints, array of Objects, class with fields)
- boolean represented by 1 bit, 0=false, 1=true
- int 32 bit signed two's complement integer
- long 64 bit two's complement integer
- String-stored as an object with an array of chars(16 bit unicode character) of a fixed size
- array of ints- holds fixed number of ints
- array of objects-memory is allocated for a fixed number of objects with a certain data size
- class with fields-stored on the heap
Write an application to find out how many total characters can be held in a list of strings before you run out of memory
- can't use the same string in the list
Compare and contrast StringBuffer and StringBuilder and when to use each
-string buffer is thread safe while stringbuilder is not (makes it faster)
-use string buffer is a string will be changed by multiple threads, string builder if it will only be one thread
Compare/contrast use of ArrayList / LinkedList / HashMap / HashSet / TreeSet
- ArrayList
    - ordered, faster get and set
    -resizable array
- LinkedList
    - faster add and remove
- HashMap
    - key-value pairs
     - not synchronized
     - no insertion order
     - fast
- HashSet
    - no duplicates
    - not synchronized
    - no insertion order
    - fast
    -constant time
- TreeSet
    - no duplicates
    -log (n) time
    - sorts in ascending order
Write your own enum type.  Describe when you would use it.
- enum direction { NORTH,SOUTH,EAST,WEST }
- only allows the variable of type direction to be set to these constants
